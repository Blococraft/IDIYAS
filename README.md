# IDIYAS
My side project and reflection of my evolution in programming.
IDIYAS is the junction of "Ideia"(in portuguese is the same meaning as Idea" and DIY that means Do It Yourself.
IDIYAS is a networking media, where people can share their craft ideas, for example:
PCB boards, homemade robots, arduino stuff, gadgets and more!
